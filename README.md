## Description of the Application
Enid Tracker is a cross-platform mobile aplication that monitors medicine consumption.

Enid's user-friendly interface provides a hassle-free experience for users of all ages. The app allows individuals to effortlessly input and manage their medication schedules, setting reminders for each dosage to ensure timely and accurate intake. Leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities, Enid Tracker offers a consistent and smooth experience on both Android and iOS devices.

#### Key Features
* **_Push Notifications_** to remind the user to take their medicine daily, morning, lunch, dinner, and bedtime. The alert will pop up in the same way a Instagram, Telegram, or any other app send push notifications to the user. This will give a familiar feel to Enid Tracker. All push notifications can be set by the user via the app. 
* **_Add New Medicine button_** will be a floating button on the home screen which will allow the user to ceate a new medicine notification/alarm for any new medication they have been prescribed. This option is always availble.
* **_Refil Notifications_** are prompts that remind the user that their medicine stock is getting low and that a visit to the pharmacy is required. This is symbolised by the change in widget color from the theme color to an amber when medicice is low, and red when the medicine is critically low. There will be a reset option for when the user has visited the pharmacy.
* **_Easily Edit Remiders_** so that updates to the user's medicine regime can be quickly adjusted on Edit tracker to reflect those changes. This will be done with a simple click on the medicine panel and the user will be given the option to edit.

_Enid Tracker is currently under construction and will be revealed in it's first iteration in March 2024._
